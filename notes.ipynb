We will find out how to write loops (*for, while*) and conditional constructs (*if, elif, else*), as well as discuss why we need *break* and *continue*.\n",

    "### Types of variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables can have different types. Some of the main types of variables in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integer: an integer is a whole number, such as 1, 2, or 3.\n",
    "- Float: a float is a decimal number, such as 1.0, 2.0, or 3.5.\n",
    "- String: a string is a sequence of characters, such as \"hello\" or \"goodbye\".\n",
    "- Boolean: a boolean variable can have one of two values, True or False.\n",
    "- List: a list is a collection of other variables, such as [1, 2, 3] or [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"].\n",
    "- Tuple: a tuple is similar to a list, but it is **immutable**, meaning that it cannot be changed once it has been created.\n",
    "- Dictionary: a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, such as {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}.\n",
